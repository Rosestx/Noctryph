# Noctryph ðŸŒ™

*A metaverse passport system for the digital shadows*

## Overview

Noctryph is a decentralized identity and reputation system built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It issues soulbound tokens (SBTs) that serve as untransferable, permanent badges of identity and reputation across virtual realms. These digital credentials glow quietly in the shadows of the digital night, enabling seamless and trustworthy participation in decentralized virtual communities.

## Features

- **Soulbound Token System**: Non-transferable identity tokens permanently linked to users
- **Cross-Metaverse Identity**: Unified identity system across multiple virtual worlds
- **Reputation Management**: Verified achievements and credentials tracking
- **Decentralized Verification**: Community-driven validation mechanisms
- **Privacy-Focused**: Selective disclosure of credentials when needed

## Technical Architecture

- **Blockchain**: Stacks Layer-1 (Bitcoin-secured)
- **Smart Contracts**: Clarity language
- **Token Standard**: Custom soulbound token implementation
- **Frontend**: React.js with Stacks.js integration
- **Testing**: Clarinet test suite

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions
- `mint-identity-badge`: Create new soulbound identity token
- `add-credential`: Add verified credential to user profile
- `verify-achievement`: Community verification of user achievements
- `get-user-profile`: Retrieve user's complete profile and credentials

### Read-Only Functions
- `get-badge-metadata`: Retrieve badge information
- `is-verified-user`: Check user verification status
- `get-reputation-score`: Calculate user's reputation score

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) installed
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+
- [Stacks Wallet](https://wallet.hiro.so/) for testnet interaction

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/noctryph.git
cd noctryph
clarinet check
```

### Testing

```bash
clarinet test
```

### Deployment

```bash
clarinet deploy --network testnet
```

## Usage Example

```clarity
;; Mint a new identity badge
(contract-call? .noctryph mint-identity-badge u1 "Digital Pioneer")

;; Add a credential
(contract-call? .noctryph add-credential u1 "Metaverse Builder" "Completed 10 virtual world projects")
```

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2025)
- Core soulbound token system
- Basic credential management
- Initial UI/UX implementation

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Q2-Q3 2025)
1. **Multi-Chain Identity Bridge**
   Implement cross-chain functionality to sync identity badges across multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana) while maintaining Stacks as the primary source of truth.

2. **AI-Powered Reputation Analysis**
   Integrate machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior patterns and automatically suggest reputation scores based on cross-platform activities and achievements.

3. **Zero-Knowledge Proof Credentials**
   Add privacy-preserving credential verification using zk-SNARKs, allowing users to prove qualifications without revealing sensitive personal information.

### Phase 3: Metaverse Integration (Q4 2025)
4. **Dynamic NFT Avatar System**
   Create evolving visual representations of user identities that change based on achievements, reputation levels, and verified credentials, integrated with popular metaverse platforms.

5. **Gaming Achievement Integration**
   Connect with popular blockchain games and metaverse platforms to automatically mint achievement badges based on in-game accomplishments and verified gameplay statistics.

6. **Metaverse Event Attendance System**
   Create an automated system that issues time-stamped attendance badges for virtual events, conferences, and meetups, with integration to major metaverse platforms and VR spaces.

### Phase 4: Community & Governance (Q1 2026)
7. **Social Recovery Mechanism**
   Implement a social recovery system where trusted community members can help users regain access to their soulbound tokens in case of key loss, using multi-signature validation.

8. **Community Governance Portal**
   Develop a DAO-style governance system where reputation-weighted voting allows the community to decide on credential standards, verification processes, and platform improvements.

### Phase 5: Professional & Market Integration (Q2-Q3 2026)
9. **Professional Certification Partnerships**
   Establish partnerships with educational institutions and professional certification bodies to issue verified academic and professional credentials as soulbound tokens.

10. **Decentralized Credential Marketplace**
    Build a peer-to-peer marketplace where users can offer skills-based services, with automatic credential verification and reputation-based pricing mechanisms.
